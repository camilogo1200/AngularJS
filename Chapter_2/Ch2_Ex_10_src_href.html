    <!--
        Documentation says that this kind of reference in images
        are not rendered properly on browser.
        I tested this code on chrome browser and I can notice not difference
        when the image is rendered using "src" or "ng-src".

        P.S:
        Looking in development console, when the page is loaded throws
        the following  error net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, maybe the image
        is rendered because angularJS is monitoring the double-brackets {{}} expressions,
        ot by the browser itself.

    <img src="img/{{myImage}}" alt="MyImage Not Loading/Rendering well." />
    <!--
        Instead, you should use the ng-src attribute and write your template as:
    -->
    <img ng-src="img/{{myImage}}" />
    <br/>

    <!--
        Similarly, for the <a> tag, you should use ng-href.
    -->
    <a href="/shop/category={{numberOfBalloons}}">some text</a>

    <a ng-href="/shop/category={{numberOfBalloons}}">some text</a>
